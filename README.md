# NASA RUL Prediction

Machine learning models for predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan degradation dataset.  
Achieved **RMSE: 2.79**, demonstrating top-tier performance on this benchmark.

Made for a presentation to illustrate python and machine learning with test data.

## âœ¨ Features
- Preprocessing pipeline for time-series sensor data
- Feature engineering (statistical, temporal, and degradation trends)
- Implementation of regression models and ensembles
- Training/validation splits aligned with NASA data structure
- Performance metric: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.8
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- matplotlib, plotly, seaborn (visualization)
- jupyter (tutorials & exploration)
